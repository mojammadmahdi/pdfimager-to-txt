# pdfimager-to-txt

You need to install the opencv-python, Pillow, pytesseract, pdf2image libraries, and Tesseract OCR and Poppler software.

This code writes the text of the images in the input.pdf file to the output.txt text file. Of course, the line separating the images is commented out for better use.
